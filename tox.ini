# mypy is a type checker for python.  It ensures that methods have type annotations and that
# the types are correct.  We should use it on all of our python projects; there is a movement
# in the python community to try to create type stubs for all major open source libraries
# via [typeshed](https://github.com/python/typeshed), similar to the [DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped)
# project for javascript/typescript.  In the not-too-distant future this will become table
# stakes for open source python libraries.
